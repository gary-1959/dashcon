# DASHCON Dash File Converter
Reads FutureNET DASH format files and converts to PDF.


## Overview
Here is all the source files for a project I did some time ago for viewing and exporting to PDF files created using the old DOS circuit design program FutureNET DASH.

It is written in C# for a Windows PC.

The file DASHCON.zip contains a downloadable installer so might be worth a try if you don't fancy rebuilding the project. 

The file DASH.zip is the FutureNET DASH program which can be made to work on DOSBOX.

If it is of any use, I'll try to answer any questions.

## FutureNet DASH

		        <h4>FutureNet DASH was a schematic capture program written for IBM DOS PCs released in the early 1980s.</h4>

				<p >It was an extremely expensive package - over $5000 at the time - and was written in assembler. After passing through various hands the software was
				released as version 6.10 in a de-restricted version, and we have made it available here as a download.
				<p>You will need a DOS-based machine to run it,
				although we found it works on <a href = "http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1" target="_blank">DOSBox</a>  quite well.
				One thing you will notice 
				is how small a screen of 800 x 600 looks, which is what DASH used to work in, but DOSBox allows you to enlarge the screen size.</p>
				<p>Refer to the DOSBox web site and help pages for more information.</p>

								<h3>File Viewer and Converter</h3>
				We have made a simple Windows program which can be used to view DASH .DWG format files. It will also save drawings as PNG images or PDF files.</p>
				<p>This 
				software is offered as-is, with no guarantees or support, but it has been tested on Windows 10, Windows 7 and XP machines and will require .Net 3.5 or greater.
				Let us know if it works for you.</p>
