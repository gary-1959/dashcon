# DASHCON Dash File Converter
Reads FutureNET DASH format files and converts to PDF.


## Overview
Here is all the source files for a project I did some time ago for viewing and exporting to PDF files created using the old DOS circuit design program FutureNET DASH.

It is written in C# for a Windows PC.

The file DASHCON.zip contains a downloadable installer so might be worth a try if you don't fancy rebuilding the project. 

If it is of any use, I'll try to answer any questions.
